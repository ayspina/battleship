Inspired by the classic holiday movie, The Grinch, *Battleship - Holiday Edition* is a lighthearted version of the popular strategy boardgame, Battleship. Most commonly played on a plastic board with pegs, Battleship has come a long way since its humble beginnings in the 1960's (though there were many similar iterations of the game dating back to the 1800's!).
